The first compiler related tool, the A-0 System, was developed in 1952[11] by Grace Hopper, who also coined the term 'compiler'.[12][13] FORTRAN, the first widely used high-level language to have a functional implementation, came out in 1957,[14] and many other languages were soon developedâ€”in particular, COBOL aimed at commercial data processing, and Lisp for computer research.\n\nThese compiled languages allow the programmer to write programs in terms that are syntactically richer, and more capable of abstracting the code, making it easy to target varying machine instruction sets via compilation declarations and heuristics. Compilers harnessed the power of computers to make programming easier[14] by allowing programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula using infix notation.",
